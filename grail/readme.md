## WARNING
This project is a personal project, i just built one prototype. It's not considered complete, nor tested or error-free.

I won't develop this much, just releasing it as-is for anybody knowledgable picking up and maybe building upon it.

It is NOT ready to take the files and produce a working keyboard!

## What is it?

Weird qaz like layout with ISO Enter.
The keyboard is gasket mounted.

See pcb for PCB files.
See 3db for two different cases (friction mount, no screws) and a special AI-design artisan keycap.

## hardware
- RPi2040 Zero

## BOM
- PCB
- RPi2040 Zero
- 32 diodes, e.g. 1N4148
- 32 key switches of your liking
- 32 key caps
- 4 rubber pads 9.5mm diameter
- USB port extension
- 5x3mm self-adhesive sealing tape for the gasket mount
- bottom case printed
- top case printed
- paint to your likings :)
- optional: dampening (I use cork in case bottom)

## Rough build instructions
- solder the diodes on top
- solder the switches on top
- solder the RPi on bottom
- mount USB extension cable and fix it inside the case
- add the sealing tape to the gaskets from all sides
- insert PCB into case bottom
- attach USB extension
