# ToKeyO Plus
This is basically an evolution of the ToKeyO keyboard, as I'm only using 3 thumb keys instead of the original 5.

Also the placement of the thumb keys is a little bit modified. The left and right thumb key also supports 1.25u and 1.5u.

Biggest change is the addition of an encoder for scrolling (or whatever you want to use it for).

The footprint supports MX, ChocV1 and Alps.
